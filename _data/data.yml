        This was a prominent program of work to deliver under their SAFe framework. 
        A complex landscape that required a deep understanding of not only the 
        transactional and data lifecycles, but also the processes, principles and 
        governance required to establish such a real-time capture of a data set.

        The solution designed to focus on the end user experience and the priority 
        transactions to support an always available digital platform. At the heart 
        of the Connect360 architecture is an IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management 
        (MDM) component and an Operational Data Store (ODS) component that have been 
        closely coupled with Cúram and integrated using IBM Integration Bus (IIB). The 
        transactional throughput is connecting with the back end ESB and the API platform. 
        The solution is hosted on the all of government Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
